## Preface
This documentation will provide the insight on to **every** method available from Matchmaking Service. This will include methods intended for internal use, these are still documented, just in case you ever need them. 

### Note
Every method here that involves a player object most likely also has an "Id" variant. Internally, everything is done with user ids, but the helper methods exist to streamline the process. This means if you see a method called `RemovePlayersFromGame`, there is another method called `RemovePlayersFromGameId` where instead of player objects, user ids are passed. If you're in doubt whether or not an id variant exists for the method you are using, I recommend [looking through the source](https://github.com/steven4547466/MatchmakingService/blob/master/matchmakingservice.lua), if it exists, it will have the same name suffixed with `Id`. "Id" variants will not be listed here unless there is no regular variant.

```lua

```

!!! info "Returns"
    | Type | Description |
    | ---- | ----------- |

## Clearing the Memory
Clears all memory aside from player data.
```lua
MatchmakingService:Clear()
```

## Listening for Players Being Added to Queue
You can listen to players being added to the queue globally. This will fire in waves when coming from other servers. This is a signal, so you need to connect to it. Below is a table of what it passes, in order.

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- | 
| number | The player's UserId |
| string | The map the player queued for |
| string | The rating type the player queued for |
| number | The rounded rating value of the player. **CAN BE NIL** |

Connecting to the listener is simple:
```lua
MatchmakingService.PlayerAddedToQueue:Connect(function(player, map, ratingType, roundedRating)
	print(player, map, ratingType, roundedRating)
end)
```

## Listening for Players Being Removed from the Queue
You can listen to players being removed from the queue globally. This will fire in waves when coming from other servers. This is a signal, so you need to connect to it. Below is a table of what it passes, in order.

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- | 
| number | The player's UserId |
| string | The map the player queued for |
| string | The rating type the player queued for |
| number | The rounded rating value of the player. **CAN BE NIL** |

Connecting to the listener is simple:
```lua
MatchmakingService.PlayerRemovedFromQueue:Connect(function(player, map, ratingType, roundedRating)
	print(player, map, ratingType, roundedRating)
end)
```

## Listening for Finding Games
You can listen for when players find games. This signal is not global. Below is a table of what it passes, in order.

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- | 
| number | The player's UserId |
| string | The unique code which identifies the game |
| table | The game data |

```lua
MatchmakingService.FoundGame:Connect(function(player, gameCode, gameData)
    print(player, gameCode, gameData)
end)
```

## Applying Custom Teleport Data to Players
You can apply custom teleport data to players to access it in the game when they are teleported. This is a function that you can bind to. You may only bind to it once. Below is a table of what it passes, in order. This function can return anything, but some things won't be replicated to other servers. Metatables and instances will not be passed correctly. This should mainly return strings and numbers, or a table of them so that you can reconstruct instances on the server, or just obtain general data that you need in the game.

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- | 
| Player | The Player |
| table | The game data |

You can bind this function like so:
```lua
MatchmakingService.ApplyCustomTeleportData = function(player, gameData)
	return {["Some"]="Custom",["Data"]="Table"}
end
```

To retrieve it **on the instance server** where players are teleported to, you'll need to do something like this:
```lua
game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
	local playerData = MatchmakingService:GetUserData(player)
    print(playerData)
end)
```
The user id is passed as a string (this is out of our control, it is converted to a string when passed), so you must use `tostring` on `player.UserId` to properly get their data.

## Applying Custom Teleport Data to the Game
You can apply custom teleport data to the game overall (which may be conditional). This is a function that you can bind to. You may only bind to it once. Below is a table of what it passes, in order. This function can return anything, but some things won't be replicated to other servers. Metatables and instances will not be passed correctly. This should mainly return strings and numbers, or a table of them so that you can reconstruct instances on the server, or just obtain general data that you need in the game.

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- | 
| table | The game data |

You can bind this function like so:
```lua
MatchmakingService.ApplyGeneralTeleportData = function(gameData)
	return {["Some"]="Custom",["Data"]="Table"}
end
```

To retrieve it **on the instance server** where players are teleported to, you'll need to do something like this:
```lua
game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
	local gameData = MatchmakingService:GetGameData() -- gets the current game's data, includes custom data
    print(gameData)
end)
```
The user id is passed as a string (this is out of our control, it is converted to a string when passed), so you must use `tostring` on `player.UserId` to properly get their data.

      local team2 = {player3, player4}
      local team3 = {player5, player6}
    ```
    Let’s say team2 came first, team1 came second and team3 came third. To update the ratings correctly, you would do this:

    `MatchmakingService:UpdateRatings("ranked", {2, 1, 3}, {team1, team2, team3})`

    `{2,1,3}` is important, and so is order. Order is extremely important here. Because I passed the teams in order, I can give the position of each team in order. As previously stated team1 placed second, therefore because team1 is the first team in the teams table, it also has the first value in the rankings table.
